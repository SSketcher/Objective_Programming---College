# TOpic 1 - One-way list
## General info
This project was about implementing one-way list. Each records containing point structure with 3 double type numbers.

* [List.h](https://github.com/SSketcher/Objective_Programming---College/blob/main/Topic_2/List.h) - header file for the one-way list class.
* [Node.h](https://github.com/SSketcher/Objective_Programming---College/blob/main/Topic_2/Node.h) - header file for  with structure "node" implementation.
* [Point.h](https://github.com/SSketcher/Objective_Programming---College/blob/main/Topic_2/Point.h) - header file for  with structure "point" implementation.
* [List.cpp](https://github.com/SSketcher/Objective_Programming---College/blob/main/Topic_2/List.cpp) - cpp file containing implementation of the class and its methodes.
* [Source.cpp](https://github.com/SSketcher/Objective_Programming---College/blob/main/Topic_2/Source.cpp) - cpp file testing the speed of the list operations. Creates list with 100 records, than prints each record to the console.
