# Topic 3 - Files operations
## General info
This project was about writing and reading data to and from files. We used two types of files binary and CSV.

* [BinaryFile.h](https://github.com/SSketcher/Objective_Programming---College/blob/main/Topic_3/BinaryFile.h) - header file for thebinary files handling class.
* [CsvFile.h](https://github.com/SSketcher/Objective_Programming---College/blob/main/Topic_3/CsvFile.h) - header file for the CSV files handling class.
* [Point.h](https://github.com/SSketcher/Objective_Programming---College/blob/main/Topic_3/Point.h) - header file for  with structure "point" implementation.
* [Errors.h](https://github.com/SSketcher/Objective_Programming---College/blob/main/Topic_3/Errors.h) - header file with enumerated errors
* [BinaryFile.cpp](https://github.com/SSketcher/Objective_Programming---College/blob/main/Topic_3/BinaryFile.cpp) - ccpp file containing implementation of the binary files handling class and its methods.
* [CsvFile.cpp](https://github.com/SSketcher/Objective_Programming---College/blob/main/Topic_3/CsvFile.cpp) - cpp file containing implementation of the CSV files handling class and its methods.
* [Main.cpp](https://github.com/SSketcher/Objective_Programming---College/blob/main/Topic_3/Main.cpp) - cpp file writing or reading poits to or from the files
