# TOpic 4 - Operators and methods overloading
## General info
This project develops [Topic 1](https://github.com/SSketcher/Objective_Programming---College/blob/main/Topic_1), adding operators and methods overloading to the list class.

* [List.h](https://github.com/SSketcher/Objective_Programming---College/blob/main/Topic_4/List.h) - header file for the one-way list class.
* [Node.h](https://github.com/SSketcher/Objective_Programming---College/blob/main/Topic_4/Node.h) - header file for  with structure "node" implementation.
* [Point.h](https://github.com/SSketcher/Objective_Programming---College/blob/main/Topic_4/Point.h) - header file for  with structure "point" implementation.
* [List.cpp](https://github.com/SSketcher/Objective_Programming---College/blob/main/Topic_4/List.cpp) - cpp file containing implementation of the class and its methodes.
* [Source.cpp](https://github.com/SSketcher/Objective_Programming---College/blob/main/Topic_4/Source.cpp) - cpp file testing the speed of the list operations. Creates list with 100 records, than prints each record to the console.
